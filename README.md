# Pipo's portfolio

## What

This project was done as an introduction to working on and with github repos.
It is the first step on creating my portfolio which will be online for the world to see what I can do!

## Why

This portfolio exsists to add and collect future work and projects in one place.

## Who

I created it myself and I guess I'll be in charge of maintenance as well.

## How

It uses a whole lot of HTML, CSS, JS, working on GitHub repos, being able to access and work in a terminal command line.

## Where

It's saved locally on a directory I created and it will be available online as long as I can remember to **git push** it.

## When

Created on the very first day at UpLeveled Bootcamp.
